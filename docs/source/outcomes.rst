=================

.. note::
    1.  Learn the basics concepts of parallel programming.
    2.  Learn the different harware components that make up an HPC machine. 
    3.  Learn how an HPC machine is organized.
    4.  Learn how to submit a Job to a PBS batch scheduler. 

In this workshop, you will begin by understanding the basics of parallel programming and familiarizing 
yourself with the hardware components that make up an HPC machine. You will then explore the organization 
of HPC systems to understand how they optimize performance, and learn how to submit jobs to a PBS batch 
scheduler.
