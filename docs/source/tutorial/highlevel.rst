High-level HPC Architecture
---------------------------

In an HPC machine, nodes are provisioned by allocating compute resources from a central pool based on the job's requirements. The system uses 
job schedulers like Slurm or PBS to manage and distribute these resources efficiently. When a job is submitted, the scheduler assigns nodes with 
the necessary compute power, memory, and storage to execute the job. Nodes can be dynamically allocated or deallocated based on job demands and system load.

**Login nodes** in an HPC cluster serve as access points for users to interact with the system, allowing tasks such as code compilation, data preparation, 
and job submission. These nodes are configured with resource limits to ensure they remain responsive and are not used for heavy computations. Users connect 
to login nodes via SSH to submit and manage jobs through the scheduler, which then allocates resources from compute nodes for actual processing. While login 
nodes handle light, interactive tasks, the primary computational work occurs on separate, dedicated nodes. These nodes also play a role in maintaining system 
security and stability through regular updates and restricted access.

On the other hand, **Compute nodes** are dedicated to executing intensive computational tasks. They are equipped with powerful processors, ample RAM, and high-speed 
networking to handle large-scale data processing and parallel computations. Managed by a job scheduler, compute nodes are allocated based on job requirements 
and are dedicated to a specific job. 

**Storage nodes** in an HPC cluster are essential for managing and providing access to large volumes of data generated by computational tasks. They use various storage 
technologies, including local disks for temporary storage and networked or parallel file systems like Lustre or GPFS for scalable, high-performance data access. 
These nodes are optimized for high throughput and low latency, integrated with the cluster's networking to facilitate fast data transfer.
